# Governance

> How SyriaHub is stewarded and how decisions are made.

---

## Stewardship Model

**PluraGate** serves as the custodian organisation for SyriaHub. Our role is:

- Maintain technical infrastructure
- Ensure platform neutrality
- Manage funding transparently
- Protect the community's interests

**PluraGate does not own the knowledge on SyriaHub.** Researchers retain rights to their work under their chosen licenses.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Political Neutrality

SyriaHub does not take positions on:
- Syrian political factions or outcomes
- International policy debates
- Contested historical interpretations

**The platform serves research, not agendas.**

Content is moderated for quality and conduct, not viewpoint.

### 2. Transparency

- Moderation decisions include explanations
- Budget and spending are public
- Governance documents are versioned
- Major changes are announced before implementation

### 3. No Profiling

SyriaHub does not:
- Build behavioural profiles of users
- Sell or share user data
- Optimise for engagement
- Personalise feeds algorithmically

Session-only AI assistance. No long-term tracking.

### 4. Community Accountability

- Appeals process for moderation decisions
- Jury panels for contested cases
- Public documentation of governance limits
- Regular community input on priorities

---

## Decision-Making Structure

### Day-to-Day Operations

**Handled by:** PluraGate maintainers

- Content moderation (per published guidelines)
- Bug fixes and routine maintenance
- Community support

### Feature Development

**Decided by:** Maintainers + community input

- Roadmap published quarterly
- GitHub Discussions for feature proposals
- Sponsors receive advisory input (not veto power)

### Funding Allocation

**Decided by:** PluraGate stewards

- Budget published in BUDGET.md
- Quarterly spend reports to sponsors
- Major allocation changes announced in advance

### Governance Changes

**Process:**
1. Proposal published in draft
2. 14-day community comment period
3. Revision based on feedback
4. Final publication with changelog

## Limits of Authority

Power is safer when its limits are written down.

### What Moderators Cannot Do

- Delete content without explanation
- Reject content for disagreeing with conclusions
- Access private messages or drafts
- Permanently ban users without review
- Override jury panel decisions
- Modify content (only approve, reject, or request revision)

### What PluraGate Cannot Do

- Decide which research conclusions are "correct"
- Declare topics too controversial to discuss
- Define who counts as a "real" researcher
- Grant exceptions to moderation rules for specific users
- Remove content based on external pressure without review
- Sell or monetise user data

---

## Moderation System

### Layers

1. **AI Pre-Filter** — Automated scan for harassment, spam, plagiarism
2. **Community Reports** — Any user can flag content
3. **Human Moderators** — Review flagged content, make decisions
4. **Jury Panel** — Multiple reviewers for contested cases

### Appeals

All moderation decisions can be appealed. Appeals are reviewed by different moderators than the original decision.

See full moderation documentation in the [SyriaHub repo](https://github.com/PluraGate/SyriaHub/blob/main/MODERATION_DOCUMENTATION.md).

## Funding Governance

### How Funds Are Used

All sponsorship funds go toward:
- Infrastructure (hosting, database, CDN)
- Development (maintenance + features)
- Operations (AI moderation, email)
- Community (moderation capacity, translations)

See [BUDGET.md](BUDGET.md) for detailed breakdown.

### Sponsor Influence

Sponsors receive:
- Transparency reports
- Advisory input on roadmap priorities
- Recognition (optional)

Sponsors do **not** receive:
- Veto power over decisions
- Content moderation influence
- User data access
- Governance control

### Conflict of Interest

If a sponsor's interests conflict with community interests, community interests prevail. We reserve the right to decline or return sponsorships that compromise platform neutrality.

---

## Unresolved Tensions (By Design)

Some tensions are inherent and should not be "solved":

| Tension | Our Approach |
|---------|--------------|
| Accessibility vs. rigor | Both matter; case-by-case judgment |
| Speed vs. thoroughness | Default to quality; expedite when needed |
| Openness vs. quality control | Invite-only maintains quality; expand gradually |
| Researcher autonomy vs. community standards | Standards apply to conduct, not conclusions |

These are not problems to fix but tensions to manage thoughtfully.

---

## Succession Planning

If PluraGate can no longer maintain SyriaHub:

1. 90-day notice to community
2. Data export tools made available to all users
3. Codebase remains open source (Apache 2.0)
4. Community may fork and continue development
5. Domain and infrastructure transferred to successor org if viable

The platform survives the stewards.
