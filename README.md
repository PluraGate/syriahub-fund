## Why Now

Syrian researchers produce valuable knowledge daily — scattered across personal drives, paywalled journals, and siloed databases. Research fragmentation wastes resources and buries local expertise under international reports.

SyriaHub centralises, connects, and opens this knowledge. Funding sustains the infrastructure that makes this possible.
