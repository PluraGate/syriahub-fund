## The Problem We Solve

### Research Fragmentation in Post-Conflict Contexts

Syria has been the subject of more academic research, humanitarian assessments, and policy analysis than almost any other contemporary crisis. Yet this knowledge remains:

- **Scattered** across institutional silos, personal archives, and paywalled journals
- **Inaccessible** to the Syrian researchers and practitioners who need it most
- **Duplicated** as organisations re-study the same questions without coordination
- **Disconnected** from the spatial and temporal context that gives it meaning

**The result:** Critical findings don't reach decision-makers. Local expertise gets buried under international reports. Resources are wasted on redundant studies while genuine gaps go unaddressed.

## Who Benefits

### Primary Beneficiaries

| Group | How SyriaHub Helps |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Syrian Researchers** | Platform to publish, cite, and build on each other's work |
| **Diaspora Academics** | Connection to in-country knowledge production |
| **Humanitarian Workers** | Rapid access to contextualised research |
| **Policymakers** | Evidence base for reconstruction decisions |
| **Students** | Research training in an academic-grade environment |

### Secondary Beneficiaries

- Other post-conflict knowledge communities (template for replication)
- Open-source research infrastructure ecosystem
- Academic institutions seeking ethical data practices models

---

## Theory of Change

```
Funding → Infrastructure → Platform Stability → Researcher Trust →
Knowledge Production → Citation Networks → Gap Resolution →
Better-Informed Decisions → Improved Outcomes
```

### Key Assumptions

1. Syrian researchers *want* to share work but lack appropriate platforms
2. Centralised knowledge reduces duplication and accelerates discovery
3. Bias-aware design (no profiling, no engagement optimisation) builds trust
4. Sustainability requires funded infrastructure, not volunteer burnout

## Evidence of Need

### What Researchers Tell Us

> "I've written three reports on Idlib healthcare. I have no idea if anyone else has too."

> "My PhD touched on water infrastructure in Aleppo. Two years later, I found another thesis on the exact same topic—we never knew about each other."

> "International organisations publish assessments, but they don't cite Syrian researchers. Our work is invisible."

*(Testimonials collected during initial outreach, 2024–2025)*

### What the Data Shows

- 10,000+ Syria-related articles indexed in academic databases (2011–present)
- Fewer than 5% are open access
- Syrian institutional affiliations represent <10% of authorship
- No centralised, open, Syria-focused research platform exists

## What Makes SyriaHub Different

| Feature | Traditional Platforms | SyriaHub |
|---------|----------------------|----------|
| Language support | English-first | Arabic RTL native |
| User profiling | Extensive | None (session-only) |
| Engagement optimisation | Yes | No |
| Moderation | Opaque | Transparent + appeals |
| Licensing | Restrictive | Apache 2.0 |
| Geographic context | Absent | Built-in spatial engine |
| Gap mapping | Manual/informal | Structural feature |

---

## Long-Term Vision

### 1–2 Years
- Establish SyriaHub as the default platform for Syria-focused research
- Expand language support (French, Turkish)
- Launch mobile application

### 3–5 Years
- Template the platform for other post-conflict contexts (Yemen, Libya, Ukraine)
- Integrate with academic databases and humanitarian coordination mechanisms
- Develop sustainable funding model (institutional subscriptions for analytics)

### 10+ Years
- SyriaHub becomes infrastructure, not a product—embedded in how Syria research is done
- PluraGate stewardship model replicated for other open knowledge initiatives

---

## The Ask

Your support funds **infrastructure**, not overhead. Every dollar goes toward:

- Keeping the platform running (hosting, database, CDN)
- Maintaining and improving the codebase
- Supporting community moderation
- Expanding language access

See [BUDGET.md](BUDGET.md) for transparent breakdown.
